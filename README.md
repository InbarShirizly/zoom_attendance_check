### 🔮 What is this platform?

- A platform that automatically detects missing students in [zoom](https://zoom.us/) meetings - using the zoom chat file.
- **Check actively** which zoom users where present in class - integrate to your student list of the class.
- **Multiple checks** in one zoom meeting - 
zoom meeting is divided to session according to the chat. In each session the program checks attendance separately.
- **English** and **Hebrew** support.
- Display the current and previous reports for the specific classroom.
- Allow teacher to **edit and manage the report**.

###  🏃‍♂️ Usage workflow

- 🖊️ **Register and Login**
- 👥 **Create new classroom** - upload `excel`/`csv` file of your student list class. `examples` can be found [here](./server/tests/files_to_test/students_list_excel).
- 📄 **Upload chat file** - upload `.txt` to the platform under the relevant classroom.
- 📝 **Manage report** - managing pop-up will appear with the already filled automatic attendance check for the teacher final decision.
    - For each student the program will assign a status color:
        - ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) - **student missing**: the student **didn't attend to any** of the teacher's sessions.
        - ![#f6ff00](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f6ff00/000000?text=+) - **student partially missing**: the student **attend only to part** of the teacher's sessions.
        - ![#27f015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/27f015/000000?text=+) - **student attendant**: means that the student **wrote in all** the teacher's sessions.
    - Teacher can change student's statuses according to his choice.
    - When report is done, the teacher will submit the report, and it will be stored in the service.
- 📊 **Classroom reports** - The teacher can view and edit reports at any time.

### 🛢️ Database - ERD

The database keeps track as following:

- `teacher` - Each user has his own account
- `classroom` - Each user has many classes
- `student` - Each classroom has many students with their personal info loaded from the excel/csv file
- `report` - Each classroom has many reports over the class, containing time of class and short description 
- `session` - Each report has many session (depend on teacher decision), session has start time - first message
- `zoom_names` + `chat`
    - **These tables are currently not supported in the platform** - should be expressed when it will part of the project
 - `student_status` - For each report, each student has status of participating in class. 
    - this value can be updated by the teacher when managing the report - without effecting the rest of the tables
